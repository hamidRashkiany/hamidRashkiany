- 👋 Hi, I’m Hamid Rashkiany. Computer science PhD student in Nanjing Hohai Uni. 
- 👀 I’m interested in artificial neural network and EEG signal processing. Learning different languages is my another hobby.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning human neural network anatomy and I am trying to utilize machine learning methods in EEG signal processing. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on human brain rythm signal to extract features and do emotion detection, intention detection, and apply EEG signal to move prosthesis muscles.
